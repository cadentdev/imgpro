  The PR is ready to merge! Would you like me to:
  1. Merge it now
  2. Review specific files first
  3. Squash the commits before merging

> Please propose a better, more descriptive title for that PR, based on your
 review of the actual changes we implemented 

● Looking at the actual changes in this PR, the current title "Add PR
  description for imagepro info feature" is misleading - it just references
  one small commit.

  The PR actually includes:

  1. Main feature: Complete imagepro info command implementation (TDD
  approach)
  2. Comprehensive testing: Test suites for both info and resize commands
  (69 tests total)
  3. CI/CD infrastructure: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
  across Python 3.8-3.11
  4. Documentation: Major README improvements, TASKS.md updates, devlog
  entries

  Proposed title:

  Implement imagepro info command with comprehensive test suite and CI/CD

  Or alternative options:

  Add image info feature with TDD tests and GitHub Actions CI

  Implement info command, add full test coverage, and setup automated
  testing

  The first one is my recommendation as it clearly conveys:
  - The main feature added (info command)
  - The testing approach (comprehensive test suite)
  - The infrastructure improvement (CI/CD)

  Would you like me to update the PR title to one of these, or would you
  prefer a different variation?

  Summary:
  - Status: MERGED
  - Merged at: 2025-12-05 15:50:17 UTC
  - Merged by: stratofax
  - Branch: claude/add-imagepro-info-tests-012rgv4ZnWgs588TpDJ8UrTs → main

  Changes merged:
  - 15 files changed
  - +5,895 additions / -86 deletions
  - New files include:
    - Complete test suite (test_info_*.py, test_resize_*.py)
    - GitHub Actions CI workflow
    - Test fixtures and configuration
    - Devlog entries including the session transcript

  Your local main branch has been updated and is now in sync with the
  remote. The feature branch can be deleted if you'd like.

> How can I delete the feature branch on my local workstation? 

● To delete the feature branch locally, you can use:

  git branch -d claude/add-imagepro-info-tests-012rgv4ZnWgs588TpDJ8UrTs

  The -d flag safely deletes the branch only if it's been merged. If you
  need to force delete an unmerged branch, you'd use -D instead.

  Since you're already on main and the branch has been merged, would you
  like me to delete it for you now?

> Thanks, but it was easy to enter the command. Plus, running the commands 
myself helps me expand my knowledge of git 

● That's a great approach! Running the commands yourself is definitely the
  best way to build muscle memory and really understand git. Feel free to
  ask if you have any questions about git or need help with anything else.
