# Prune Stale Branches - 2026-01-12

## Session Summary

Cleaned up stale local and remote git branches, verified merged work, and updated the remote URL to reflect the repository rename from imagepro to imgpro.

## Work Completed

### Branch Cleanup
- Ran `git fetch --prune` to sync remote-tracking refs
- Identified 5 stale local branches that weren't showing as merged (due to squash merges)
- Investigated each branch to verify content was already on main:
  - `instagram-guide` - squash-merged via PR #8
  - `feature/heif-support-and-docs` - HEIF work already on main
  - `docs/info-requirements` - early PRD version, superseded
  - `claude/rename-imagepro-to-imgpro-*` - rename work merged via PR #10
  - `claude/review-imagepro-status-*` - convert/rename commands merged via PR #9
- Deleted all 5 stale local branches

### Remote Cleanup
- Deleted merged `scripts/instagram` branch from remote (PR #11 was already merged)
- Updated remote URL from `cadentdev/imagepro.git` to `cadentdev/imgpro.git`

### Verification
- Confirmed no "imagepro" references remain in code files (only in historical devlogs)
- Verified convert and rename commands exist on main
- Final state: only `main` branch locally and remotely

## Commands Used

```bash
git fetch --prune
git branch -a
git branch --merged main
git log main..<branch> --oneline
git diff main..<branch> --stat
git branch -D <branch>
git push origin --delete scripts/instagram
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cadentdev/imgpro.git
```

## Key Insight

Squash merges don't show up in `git branch --merged` because the commit SHAs differ. To verify squash-merged branches, compare file content with `git diff` rather than relying on merge detection.

## Final Branch State

| Branch | Location | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| main | local + remote | current, clean |
