# Changelog

All notable changes to ImgPro will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Custom field selection for `imgpro info` command
- AVIF output format support
- `--no-srgb` flag for convert command
- `--verbose` and `--quiet` modes

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Refactored** codebase for improved maintainability:
  - Named constants for all exit codes, quality defaults, and output directory name
  - All imports moved to module top level
  - Context managers on all `Image.open()` calls (fixed 3 resource leaks)
  - `sys.exit()` removed from helper functions (raise exceptions instead)
  - Shared helpers extracted: `resolve_output_dir()`, `validate_input_file()`, `ensure_rgb_for_jpeg()`
  - `validate_jpeg()` (extension-only) eliminated in favor of content-based `get_image_format()`
  - Parser construction modularized into per-command functions
  - `cmd_info` output formatters extracted into dedicated functions
- **Security hardening** (13 findings from adversarial red-team review):
  - Path traversal protection on `--output` flag (rejects `..` components and null bytes)
  - Decompression bomb limit: 100 megapixel cap + 500MB file size cap
  - Symlink detection on input (warn) and output directories (reject)
  - Resize size count capped at 20
  - Overwrite warning in rename command
  - Bare `except:` replaced with `except Exception:` in `serialize_exif_value()`
  - Specific `PyCMSError` catch in `convert_to_srgb()`
  - Partial output file cleanup on conversion failure
  - Chain integrity verification for intermediate files
  - GPS metadata stripped by default when EXIF is preserved in convert
  - Secure temp files via `tempfile.mkstemp()` in case-insensitive rename
  - ASCII-only validation for EXIF date prefix digits

### Added
- `tests/test_security.py` - 25 security-focused tests covering path traversal, decompression bombs, symlinks, size limits, GPS stripping, and more

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Command chaining** with `+` separator: output of each command feeds into the next
  - `imgpro convert photo.heic --format jpeg + resize --width 1080`
  - Multi-file fan-out: resize with multiple widths chains each output individually
- **Source-relative output directory**: default `output/` is created next to the source file, not CWD
  - Chained commands reuse the output directory when input is already in `output/`

### Changed
- Updated version to 1.3.0
- Documentation updated for command chaining and source-relative output

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-12

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Resize command now uses positional `<file>` argument instead of `--input` flag
  - Before: `imgpro resize --input photo.jpg --width 300`
  - After: `imgpro resize photo.jpg --width 300`
  - Aligns resize command with other commands (info, rename, convert) per PRD specification

### Added
- `scripts/prepare-instagram.sh` - Automated workflow for Instagram image preparation (convert, resize, organize)
- `scripts/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation for batch processing scripts
- `DONE.md` - Archive file for completed development tasks

### Fixed
- Renamed project from `imagepro` to `imgpro` for consistency

### Documentation
- Updated README with improved formatting and consistency
- Updated all resize command examples to use positional file argument
- Cleaned up CLAUDE.md and removed outdated CLI discrepancy section
- Reorganized task tracking (TASKS.md cleaned up, completed tasks moved to DONE.md)

---

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- **WebP output format support** for `imgpro convert` command
- **Batch processing scripts** in `scripts/` directory:
  - `rename-all.sh` - Add EXIF date prefix and correct extensions
  - `convert-all.sh` - Convert images to JPEG with sRGB profile
  - `resize-all.sh` - Resize images to specified width(s)
  - `organize-by-orientation.sh` - Organize by orientation or aspect ratio
- `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive usage examples
- sRGB color profile conversion (automatic) for convert command
- EXIF preservation by default in convert command
- `--strip-exif` flag for convert command

### Fixed
- Case-insensitive filesystem handling for rename command (macOS/Windows)

### Changed
- Default JPEG quality changed from 90 to 80 for convert command
- Updated documentation (README, TASKS, PRD) to reflect v1.2.0 features

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- HEIF/HEIC format support via `pillow-heif` package
- Comprehensive documentation updates (README, PRD, TASKS, CLAUDE.md)
- Test coverage improvements toward 100%
- Bash error handling patterns documented in README

### Changed
- Updated version to 1.1.0
- Improved test fixtures with synthetic EXIF data

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-12

  - EXIF extraction with curated subset (date taken, camera make/model, DPI)
  - Three output formats: default (human-readable), `--json`, `--short` (CSV)
  - `--exif` and `--exif-all` flags for EXIF data display
