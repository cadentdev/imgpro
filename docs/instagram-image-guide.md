# Instagram Image Preparation Guide

## Supported Aspect Ratios

Instagram supports the following aspect ratios for feed posts[1]:

- **Portrait (Vertical)**: 4:5 (recommended standard) or 3:4 (native smartphone format, added in 2025)
- **Square**: 1:1
- **Landscape (Horizontal)**: Up to 1.91:1 (approximately 16:9)

**Unsupported**: 4:3 aspect ratio is not natively supported. If you upload a 4:3 image, it will be automatically cropped or adjusted to fit within Instagram's supported range[1].

### Aspect Ratio Tolerance
Instagram allows a 1% tolerance on aspect ratios to account for minor variations in image dimensions[2].

## Recommended Image Dimensions

When preparing photos for Instagram, use these pixel dimensions for optimal quality[2][3][4]:

### Square Posts
- **Dimensions**: 1080 × 1080 pixels
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1
- **Use Case**: Balanced visual content

### Portrait (Vertical) Posts
- **Dimensions**: 1080 × 1350 pixels (4:5 ratio) or 1080 × 1440 pixels (3:4 ratio)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:5 or 3:4
- **Use Case**: Taller images that take up more vertical space in feeds
- **Note**: The 3:4 format is newer and matches native smartphone camera formats[5]

### Landscape (Horizontal) Posts
- **Dimensions**: 1080 × 566 pixels
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1.91:1 (approximately 16:9)
- **Use Case**: Wide-angle shots and panoramic images

### Minimum Requirements
- **Minimum width**: 320 pixels
- **Maximum**: Up to 2048 pixels on the longest side
- **Recommended minimum width for best quality**: **1080 pixels**[2][4]
- **Maximum file size**: 8 MB per image[6]

## Image Count Per Post

### Maximum Images Per Carousel
- **Limit**: 20 photos and/or videos per carousel post[7][8]
- **Previous limit**: 10 images (expanded in August 2024)
- **Rollout status**: Gradual rollout; not all accounts have access to the 20-image limit yet. Some users still experience the 10-image maximum[7][9]

### Recommended Image Count
While you can post up to 20 images per carousel, engagement experts recommend using **3–5 images** per post for optimal engagement[7]. Viewer engagement drops significantly after the first few slides.

### Multiple Photos with Different Aspect Ratios
If you upload multiple photos with different aspect ratios to a single carousel post[10]:

**Without the "Mixed" option**: Instagram automatically crops all photos to match the aspect ratio of the first image, potentially cutting off important content.

**With the "Mixed" option enabled**: You can preserve each photo's original aspect ratio, allowing vertical, horizontal, and square photos in the same carousel. However, this feature requires the first image to be in 4:5 format for reliable operation.

## Supported File Formats

Instagram accepts the following image file formats for photo uploads[11][12]:

- **JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)** – Recommended format for most photos
- **PNG (.png)** – Best for graphics, text, or images with transparency
- **BMP (.bmp)** – Supported but rarely used
- **GIF (.gif)** – Non-animated GIFs only

## Optimal JPEG Export Settings

For the best results when uploading JPEG images, follow these guidelines[12][13]:

### Export Quality
- **Export quality level**: 80% (high quality)
- **Why**: Balances image sharpness with file size to minimize aggressive recompression by Instagram's servers

### Color Profile
- **Use**: **sRGB color profile** (standard for web images)
- **Why**: Prevents unexpected color shifts when Instagram processes your image

### File Size
- **Target**: Keep files reasonably compressed before upload
- **Maximum**: 8 MB per image (Instagram's hard limit)
- **Why**: Instagram automatically recompresses all images regardless of format. Uploading an overly large, uncompressed file may trigger excessive compression, causing blur or color degradation[13]

### Export Recommendations
- Export JPEG at approximately 80% quality with sRGB color profile
- Ensure dimensions match one of Instagram's recommended sizes (1080 px width standard)
- Verify the final file size doesn't exceed 8 MB
- Test one image before uploading a full carousel to ensure quality meets your expectations

**Why JPEG over PNG**: While PNG files are supported, they are typically larger than JPEGs and may trigger more aggressive compression by Instagram. JPEG is the optimal choice for photographic content[11][12][13].

## Best Practices for High-Quality Instagram Images

### Pre-Upload Checklist
- [ ] Image dimensions match one of the recommended sizes (1080 × 1350 for portrait, 1080 × 1080 for square, 1080 × 566 for landscape)
- [ ] Aspect ratio falls within 1.91:1 to 4:5 range (1:1 for square)
- [ ] File format is JPEG (recommended) or PNG
- [ ] JPEG exported at 80% quality with sRGB color profile
- [ ] File size is under 8 MB per image
- [ ] Important content is centered and not within 250 pixels of the top/bottom edges (to avoid being obscured by profile photo and CTA buttons)
- [ ] Color accuracy checked in sRGB color space

### Carousel Post Considerations
- [ ] First image is in a supported aspect ratio (preferably 4:5 or square)
- [ ] All images meet quality standards listed above
- [ ] If mixing aspect ratios, the "Mixed" option is enabled and the first image is in 4:5 format
- [ ] Keeping to 3–5 images for optimal engagement (though up to 20 are supported)

### Content Composition
- [ ] Text and logos are centered to avoid cropping by Instagram's UI elements
- [ ] Important visual elements are in the center of the frame
- [ ] Images are clear and well-lit
- [ ] No excessive watermarks or branding that obscures the image

### Post-Upload Validation
- [ ] Preview the post before publishing to check for any unexpected cropping or color shifts
- [ ] Test on both mobile and desktop views if possible
- [ ] Monitor early engagement to identify any image quality issues
